# MacRanger

MacRanger is a fork of ranger that adds in OSX and iTerm2 specific
features like inline image display and quicklook previews.

For an optimal experience it should be used with the
[MacRanger-App](//github.com/trishume/MacRanger-App) wrapper.

## Fanciness

Nice icons and cool look, when used with the app it has things like a draggable icon in the title bar as well as OSX file preview images.

## Limitations

Mostly the same as ranger. Everything is synchronous so it lags a lot for me, especially when scrolling through folders with images.

Currently not easy to install for anyone but me, needs the command line thing, a wrapper app, a config file, a prefs file for the terminal, and an icon font in order to look like mine does.
